# Data Analysis Dashboard

This project is a **Data Analysis Dashboard** built using **Flask**, **Bootstrap**, **Seaborn**, and **Matplotlib**. It allows users to upload datasets, analyze them interactively, and visualize various features using machine learning models and exploratory data analysis tools.

---

## Features

1. **Upload Dataset**: Users can upload CSV files for analysis.
2. **Target Variable Analysis**:
   - Choose a target variable for analysis.
   - Generate correlation heatmaps, pairplots, and distribution plots.
3. **Data Exploration**:
   - View summary statistics for numeric and non-numeric columns.
   - Explore feature correlations.
   - Detect and handle missing values.
   - Detect and handle outliers.
4. **Machine Learning**:
   - Predict outcomes based on a simple regression or classification model.
   - Display model scores for the target variable.
5. **Dark/Light Theme Toggle**: Switch between themes for better usability.
